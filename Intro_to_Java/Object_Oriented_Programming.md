# Object Oriented Programming

* `Object Oriented Programming`: (OOP) A programming paradigm where
  - Data and functionality are combined and are wrapped inside something called an object.
  - An `object` is a data structure consisting of **states (fields)** and **behaviours (Methods)**.
  - OOP is a way of programming that is based on the interactions of these objects.
  - We define the data types and the operations that can be applied to these types.
  
  
 * `Class`: A template of an object
  - Describes the fields and methods an object of its type supports. 

## 4 Key Principles of Java

1. Inheritance: Process where one class acquires methods and fields from another.

2. Polymorphism: Ability of an object to take many forms. 

3. Abstraction: Focus on higher levels of programming (functionality) rather than details of parts (implementation).

4. Encapsulation: Wrapping fields and methods in single well defined units.
