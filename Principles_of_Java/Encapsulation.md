# Encapsulation

* Wrapping fields and methods together in single units, that are well defined.
  * Fields are hidden from other classes and can only be accessed through methods of the class (data hiding). 

1. Declare fields private 
2. Provide public getters and setters

* Class can be made read only or write only.
* Class has total control of what is stored in its field
* Promotes loose coupling

**Coupling:** Links between separate units of a program. Aim for loose coupling. <br> <br>
**Cohesion:** High cohesion = well defined units of code. Low cohesion = units have large numbers and diversity of jobs. Aim for high cohesion.
